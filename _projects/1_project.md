<p>
    GIDEA is an AI-driven simulation platform that streamlines human-computer interaction (HCI) experiments by 
    automating user interactions and experiment management. Traditional HCI studies require extensive manual 
    effort, but GIDEA accelerates this process using <strong>large language models (LLMs)</strong> to generate 
    realistic interaction scenarios dynamically.
</p>

<h2>Key Features</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>LLM-Driven Virtual Participants:</strong> Simulated avatars with unique personalities engage in 
        real-time interactions based on structured research prompts.</li>
    <li><strong>Real-Time Experiment Control with Unity:</strong> Researchers define objectives, control environments, 
        and monitor experiments dynamically.</li>
    <li><strong>Virtual Reality (VR) Integration:</strong> GIDEA supports immersive experimentation with VR setups, 
        enabling embodied interaction studies.</li>
    <li><strong>Case Study Validation:</strong> The platform has been tested against real-world HCI studies, 
        demonstrating statistically consistent results.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Experiment Workflow</h2>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Define Research Questions:</strong> Researchers specify objectives and experimental conditions.</li>
    <li><strong>Simulate Interactions:</strong> LLM-driven avatars engage in realistic interactions.</li>
    <li><strong>Monitor & Adjust:</strong> The Unity-based dashboard provides real-time control.</li>
    <li><strong>Analyze & Compare:</strong> Simulated results are validated against real-world data.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    With <strong>GIDEA</strong>, researchers can conduct scalable, efficient, and adaptive HCI studies, 
    accelerating intelligent system evaluation.
